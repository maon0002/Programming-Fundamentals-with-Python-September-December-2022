#     2. Add and Subtract
# You will receive three integer numbers.
# Write functions named:
#     â€¢ sum_numbers() that returns the sum of the first two integers
#     â€¢ subtract() that returns the difference between the returned result of the first function and the third integer
# Wrap the two functions in a function named add_and_subtract() which will receive the three numbers as parameters. Print the result of the subtract() function on the console.
